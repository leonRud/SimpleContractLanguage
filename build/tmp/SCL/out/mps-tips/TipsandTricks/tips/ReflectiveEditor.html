<p>Right click on any node (including the diff view) and choose <b>Show Reflective Editor</b>. The reflective editor,
    which structurally lists all nodes' properties, children and references, will be shown. It allows you to edit the model directly,
    without the intervention of an editor. Hitting <b>F5</b> will quickly restore the editors back.
