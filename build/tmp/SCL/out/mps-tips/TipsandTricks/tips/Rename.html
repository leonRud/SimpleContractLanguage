    <p>You may easily rename nodes, methods and variables with automatic correction of all places where they are used.</p>
      <p>To try it, position the editor caret at any symbol and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:RenameElement;</span>
      (<span class="control">Refactoring | Rename</span> in the pop-up menu).
      Type the new name in the dialog that appears and press
      <span class="shortcut">Enter</span>.</p>
      <p>Being positioned on the element name declaration directly, you may just start typing to rename the symbol together with all references to it.</p>
